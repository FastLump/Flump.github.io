<p>It’s the end of the fall semester, and I have one last final exam problem to grade for the semantics class I’m TAing for. Actually, it’s the first problem on the exam, but I saved it till last because nearly every student seems to have gotten it totally wrong. Which is surprising, given that the problem revolves around one of the first concepts the students learned, a concept that is central to formal semantics: generating and interpreting expressions in some suitable way. What’s more, they even saw the converse (so to speak) of this problem on the midterm.</p>
<p>The problem says to use the symbols <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(e\)</span> to generate a set of expressions that denote all and only the natural numbers (i.e., the set of non-negative integers) and to do so without any natural number being named more than once. In other words, provide syntactic formation rules for generating infinitely many expressions from just those five letters, and provide semantic valuation rules for mapping those expressions onto the natural numbers, such that each expression corresponds to exactly one natural number, and each natural number is the correspondent of exactly one expression, i.e., an isomorphism between the set of <span class="math">\(abcde\)</span>-expressions and the set of natural numbers. (The problem on the midterm was the converse: to decide whether the set of expressions formed, in some given way, from the four letters <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(d\)</span> were, under some given valuation rules, isomorphic to the natural numbers.)</p>
<p>The spirit of the problem, I think, is to use all and only the (mutually distinct) letters <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(e\)</span>. However, in principle the problem can be solved using just one letter.</p>
<p>For example, let <span class="math">\(L = \{a\}\)</span>. Then we can generate an infinite set <span class="math">\(E\)</span> of expressions with the following recursive formation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math">\(a \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(x \in E\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(xa \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>Nothing else is a member of <span class="math">\(E\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rule 2 is essentially a suffixation rule. Thus, <span class="math">\(E\)</span> contains the expressions <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(aa\)</span>, <span class="math">\(aaa\)</span>, etc., where we suffix a single <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to any already well-formed expression to generate a new well-formed expression. We can interpret these expressions with the following valuation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math">\(v(a) = 0\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(x \in E\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(xa = v(x) + 1\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, for example, we have the following valuations.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
v(a)   &amp;= 0 \\
v(aa)  &amp;= v(a) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\
v(aaa) &amp;= v(aa) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\
       &amp;\ldots
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>And in general, <span class="math">\(v(a^n) = n-1\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a^n\)</span> is shorthand for the expression consisting of exactly <span class="math">\(n\)</span> occurrences of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Clearly, these valuation rules make the set <span class="math">\(E\)</span> isomorphic to the set of natural numbers: each expression in <span class="math">\(E\)</span> correpsonds to exactly one natural number, and each natural number is in turn the correspondent of (is expressible by) exactly one expression in <span class="math">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p>But this language isn’t all that interesting. More interesting are the languages formed from two or more letters. For example, let <span class="math">\(L = \{a, b\}\)</span> and consider the following formation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math">\(x \in L\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(x \in E\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x \neq a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y \in L\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(xy \in E\)</span>.</li>
<li>Nothing else is a member of <span class="math">\(E\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, rule 2 is a suffixation rule, with the stipulation that nothing can be suffixed to <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. (We’ll see why in a moment.) Thus, <span class="math">\(E\)</span> contains the expressions <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(ba\)</span>, <span class="math">\(bb\)</span>, <span class="math">\(baa\)</span>, <span class="math">\(bab\)</span>, etc., but <span class="math">\(E\)</span> does not contain the expressions <span class="math">\(aa\)</span>, <span class="math">\(ab\)</span>, <span class="math">\(aba\)</span>, etc. The reason for excluding these latter expressions should become clear from the following valuation rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math">\(v(a) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v(b) = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(x \in E\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x \neq a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y \in L\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(v(xy) = 2 \cdot v(x) + v(y)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(v(a) = 0\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(aa\)</span> were a well-formed expression, i.e., if the condition “<span class="math">\(x \neq a\)</span>” were removed, then the valuation of <span class="math">\(aa\)</span> would be the same as that of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. That is, the valuation rules would fail to make <span class="math">\(E\)</span> isomorphic to the set of natural numbers because there would be at least one natural number, namely <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, that has more than one correspondent in <span class="math">\(E\)</span>. (<span class="math">\(0\)</span> would be expressible by more than one <span class="math">\(abcde\)</span>-expression.)</p>
<p>Continuing on, we have the following valuations.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
v(a)    &amp;= 0 \\
v(b)    &amp;= 1 \\
v(ba)   &amp;= 2 \cdot v(b) + v(a) = 2 \cdot 1 + 0 = 2 \\
v(bb)   &amp;= 2 \cdot v(b) + v(b) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3 \\
v(baa)  &amp;= 2 \cdot v(ba) + v(a) = 2 \cdot 2 + 0 = 4 \\
v(bab)  &amp;= 2 \cdot v(ba) + v(b) = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \\
        &amp;\ldots
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This language, and its interpretation, should look familiar: it’s binary, except we’ve replaced <span class="math">\(0\)</span> with <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span> with <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. The following table shows the expressions of <span class="math">\(E\)</span>, the corresponding expressions in binary, and the corresponding expressions in decimal; and of course by “corresponding” expressions we mean expressions whose valuations are the same natural number.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
L=\{a,b\} &amp;&amp; \text{Binary} &amp;&amp; \text{Decimal} \\
a         &amp;&amp; 0             &amp;&amp; 0 \\
b         &amp;&amp; 1             &amp;&amp; 1 \\
ba        &amp;&amp; 10            &amp;&amp; 2 \\
bb        &amp;&amp; 11            &amp;&amp; 3 \\
baa       &amp;&amp; 100           &amp;&amp; 4 \\
bab       &amp;&amp; 101           &amp;&amp; 5 \\
bba       &amp;&amp; 110           &amp;&amp; 6 \\
bbb       &amp;&amp; 111           &amp;&amp; 7 \\
baaa      &amp;&amp; 1000          &amp;&amp; 8 \\
\ldots    &amp;&amp; \ldots        &amp;&amp; \ldots
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>From here it’s easy to see that the solution to the problem, with <span class="math">\(L = \{a,b,c,d,e\}\)</span>, amounts to devising a base-5 language. I won’t write down the answer here, just in case some student stumbles on this post, but extending the binary, or two-letter, case is pretty straightforward.</p>

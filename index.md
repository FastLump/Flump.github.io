I'm a linguist currently working
as a postdoctoral researcher
at the [Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique][lscp],
a [CNRS][cnrs] lab,
at the [École Normale Supérieure][ens] in Paris.
I specialize in
formal and experimental semantics and pragmatics.
This means I use math and logic
to model how humans
transmit thoughts back and forth,
often using experimental methods along the way
to help refine the models.

Specific research topics include
numerical expressions,
distributivity and collectivity,
plurality,
questions,
ignorance and grammar,
and competition in human language and beyond.

Apart from linguistics,
I enjoy tinkering with Linux,
learning about functional programming (like Haskell),
and (when I have time) brewing beer.
You can read about some of that stuff [here](/blog/).

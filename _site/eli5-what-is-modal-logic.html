    <p>Someone recently asked me what sort of background knowledge is required to study
modal logic. I thought I’d share my reply here, in case it might be of use to
people.</p>

<p>My first taste of modal logic was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Montague">Richard Montague</a>’s intensional logic
(IL), as applied to natural language. IL is a complex combination of
higher-order typed logic (with typed λ-terms) and two types of modal logic (see
the end of this post). Needless to say, I struggled long and hard to disentangle
the pieces and understand them individually. In fact, for a while, I thought
that modal logic <em>was</em> IL. It was only later that I discovered that, actually,
even basic propositional logic can be modalized.</p>

<p>I strongly believe now that the study of modal logic (be it in a logic course or
in a natural language semantics course) should begin modal propositional logic,
not modal predicate (quantificational) logic. Modality and quantification can
much more easily be combined once they are each individually well understood.</p>

<p>If you’re new to modal logic and have, up to now, felt a little intimidated or
confused by it, then hopefully the preceding paragraphs have eased your mind. If
not, then hopefully the rest of this post will.</p>

<h2 id="explain-it-like-im-5-what-is-modal-logic">Explain it like I’m 5: What is modal logic?</h2>

<p>Modal logic is an extension of other, more basic types of logic, primarily
classical <em>propositional logic</em> and <em>predicate logic</em>. You can learn modal logic
once you’ve learned propositional logic. You do <em>not</em> need to know predicate
logic to learn modal logic, although in practice many modal logics are
extensions of predicate logic, which itself is an extension of propositional
logic.</p>

<p>Here are some types of logic, in order (more or less) of increasing complexity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Propositional logic</strong> is the simplest logic. It contains <em>propositional
variables</em> (p, q, r, …) and <em>logical connectives</em> (¬, ∧, ∨, →, …). You can
create formulas like p, p ∧ q, (p ∨ ¬q) → r, etc. The truth value of a complex
formula ϕ (one containing logical connectives) is a function of the truth
values of the immediate subformulas of ϕ, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table"><em>truth tables</em></a>
for the logical connectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Non-quantificational predicate logic</strong> extends propositional logic by
creating atomic formulas out of <em>n</em>-place <em>predicate symbols</em> (P, R, S, …),
i.e. symbols that take <em>n</em> <em>individual symbols</em> (a, b, c, …) to create a
formula, such as Pa, Rab, Sabc, etc. The individual symbols are taken from a
<em>domain (or universe) of individuals</em>, D (or U). This logic still contains the
logical connectives, so you can create complex formulas like Pa ∧ (Rab →
¬Sabc). As in propositional logic, the truth value of a complex formula ϕ is a
function of the truth values of the immediate subformulas of ϕ, based on the
truth tables for the logical connectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quantificational (first-order) predicate logic</strong> extends
non-quantificational predicate logic by adding <em>individual variables</em> (x, y,
z, …) and <em>quantifier symbobls</em> (∃, ∀) that operate over individual
variables. You can create formulas like ∀xPx, ∃x∃yRxy, Pa ∧ ∀x(Sxbc → Px),
etc. The truth value of a formula ϕ with a quantifier depends on whether the
formula in the immediate scope of the quantifier is true of some (in the case
of ∃) or all (in the case of ∀) individuals in the domain (roughly speaking).
For example, ∃xPx is true iff P is holds of <em>some</em> individual in the domain,
and ∀xPx is true iff P holds of <em>every</em> individual in the domain (roughly
speaking). (<strong>Second-</strong> and other <strong>higher-order predicate logics</strong> are
extensions of first-order predicate logic, which allow quantification not only
over individuals, but also over sets (of sets (…(of sets)…)) of
individuals.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modal propositional logic</strong> extends propositional logic by adding
<em>intensional operators</em> (e.g. ◇, □) and a <em>domain of possible worlds</em> and by
making truth value assignments world-dependent, meaning that a formula ϕ only
has a truth value relative to (or “in”) a possible world. This means that it
no longer makes sense to say that ϕ is true or or that ϕ is false; rather, we
say that ϕ is true in (relative to) w1, false in w2, and so on. (A formula
generally has different truth values in different possible worlds.) You can
make formulas like p, p ∧ q, □p, □p → ◇q, etc. The truth value of a formula ϕ
with an intensional operator depends on whether the formula in the immediate
scope of the operator is true in some (in the case of ◇) or all (in the case
of □) worlds accessible from the world relative to which ϕ is evaluated. For
example, ◇p is true in w iff p is true in <em>some</em> world v which is accessible
from w, and □p is true in w iff p is true in <em>every</em> world v which is
accessible from w. Which worlds are accessible from which other worlds is
determined by an <em>accessibility relation</em>. Accessibility relations play a huge
role in modal logic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modal predicate logic</strong> extends modal propositional logic in the same way
that non-modal predicate logic extends non-modal propositional logic. It thus
contains both intensional operators and quantifier symbols, so you can create
complicated formulas like ◇(Rab → ∃x∀y(¬□Px ∧ □Sxy)).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Different intensional operators and different accessibility relations give rise
to different modal logics, some of which have been used to model various
real-world phenomena. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>possibility and necessity (<strong>alethic logic</strong>)</li>
  <li>permission and obligation (<strong>deontic logic</strong>)</li>
  <li>knowledge (<strong>epistemic logic</strong>)</li>
  <li>belief (<strong>doxastic logic</strong>)</li>
  <li>time (<strong>temporal logic</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of time, possible “worlds” model points in time and are ordered by
an “earlier than” relation, e.g. “t1 &lt; t2” means t1 is earlier in time than t2.
Thus, the domain of possible worlds/times/states can have quite a rich
structure; that is, it need not be a simple set, but can in addition have
structure (relations, etc.) defined on it.</p>

<p>Montague’s intensional logic actually includes both worlds and times, so that a
formula ϕ is said to be true (or false) in a particular world, at a particular
time. Thus, ϕ can be true in w at time t1, but false in w at time t2; and ϕ can
be true in w1 at time t, but false in w2 at time t; and so forth.</p>

After (re-)reading Matt Might's [blog post][mm] encouraging PhD students to
write blogs, I've finally decided to give it a whirl. Actually, this isn't my
first blog, but my previous one failed miserably for one simple reason: I set
the bar too high for myself. I only wanted to write high-quality linguistics
posts, which ended up meaning one post every six months.

For this blog, instead, I'm going to write about any random thing that I feel
like. Since it's just a personal blog, that'll most likely be linux hacks and
half-baked linguistics squibs. Too often have I spent several hours solving an
issue, only to have to deal with it again three months later, with no memory of
the solution. Therefore, at the very least, this blog will be a reference
repository of hacks that few others will care about (or maybe it'll help
someone out there).

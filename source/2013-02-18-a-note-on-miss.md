A question posted on [/r/vim](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/), the subreddit
devoted to the [vim][] text editor, has made me think twice about the meaning
of the verb "miss" and its various forms:

```
What feature do you miss from vim?
```

Before we discuss the meaning of "miss" here, take a second and decide what you
think the above question is asking, and (if anything) is implying.

Got it? OK, let's go.

When I first read the question, I thought the original poster (OP) meant: What
feature *that used to be in vim, but is no longer in vim*, do you miss? I
probably came to this interpretation by analogy with

```
I miss feature F in (from) vim.
```

which to me implies that vim once supported F but now no longer does. More
generally, to me "I miss X" implies that X used to exist (in some
context--dependent sense) but no longer does. For example:

```
I miss my dog, Rosco.

I miss Italy.

When I'm in Montreal, I miss eating boiled crawfish.
```

The first sentence implies that Rosco is no longer with the speaker: maybe
Rosco died, or ran away, or maybe the speaker is away on vacation. The second
sentence implies that the speaker was once in Italy but no longer is. The third
sentence implies that the speaker used to eat (and enjoy eating) crawfish,
e.g., while he lived in Louisiana, but when in Montreal no longer eats them.
And so forth. (Clearly, the notion of "(no longer) exists" is pretty loose
here, as it can be instantiated, e.g., as separation between a person and his
dog, etc.)

These implications are probably presuppositions associated with "miss". That's
why if you negate any of the above sentences, the implications persist, and
that's why the OP's original question has, to me, such an implication.
(Presuppositions persist under negation, questioning, etc.)

It turns out, however, that what the OP meant was: What feature that does not
exist (and has, in fact, *never* existed) in vim do you wish existed? Huh!
Well, luckily for me, I was not the only one who was confused. Another user,
TankorSmash,
[wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/18n05l/what_feature_do_you_miss_from_vim/c8g762d):

```
I don't understand, you're implying we don't have vim anymore.
```

to which yet another user, onwardAgain, replied:

```
I think he means "what functionality would you like that is missing".
```

A couple things to note here. First, whereas I thought the OP was asking about
*features* that no longer exist, TankorSmash thought the OP was implying that
*vim* no longer exists. On either interpretation, I think the point still
stands that use of the verb "miss" implies that some contextually dependent
thing no longer exists, in some contextually dependent sense.

Second, it's interesting that onwardAgain paraphrased the OP's question in a
totally comprehensible, non--confusing way by recycling the word "miss", but
now in the form "miss**ing**". Let me explain.

Whereas the sentence "I miss feature F (in vim)" to me implies that F once
existed (in vim) but no longer does, the sentence "Feature F is missing
(in/from vim)" does *not* imply any such thing. More precisely, the latter
asserts that F currently does not exist in vim, but does *not* imply that F
once did exist in vim. (It does, however, probably imply that F *should* exist
in vim.)

Returning now to the Rosco, Italy, and crawfish examples, note that
transforming them from "miss" sentences to "is missing" sentences produces
weird results.

```
My dog, Rosco, is missing.

Italy is missing.

When I'm in Montreal, eating boiled crawfish is missing.
```

Only the first one makes any real sense, but even that one means something
quite different from what "I miss my dog, Rosco" means. Both sentences imply
that the speaker and Rosco are no longer together, but they differ pretty
drastically in what they imply about the separation of the speaker from Rosco:
the "miss" version implies very little about the reason for their separation
(maybe Rosco died or ran away, maybe the speaker sold him or is on vacation),
whereas the "is missing" version is more narrow. If Rosco died, or if I sold
him, or if I were on vacation, I could not say, "Rosco is missing".

So it's interesting that transitive "miss" and adjectival "missing" both have
to do with some loose notion of nonexistence, or separation, yet differ pretty
wildly in what they imply about that nonexistence. (Or to put it differently,
they differ in which contexts are appropriate for their use.)

Moreover, I think the intuition is clear that neither "X misses Y" entails "Y
is missing", nor does "Y is missing" entail "Y is missed (by someone)".

And there are many other uses of transitive "miss" based on a similar loose
notion of nonexistence, or separation, like "to miss the train", "to miss the
point", "to miss the target", "to miss an entry (in a list)", etc. (see
[here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/miss)).

It's unclear to me how one could assign a uniform semantics to "miss" that gets
all these usages straight, or even whether one would want to. Clearly, "miss"
and "missing" must have different semantics, but must all the different
versions, so to speak, of transitive "miss" also have their own semantics?
That is, transitive "miss" is ambiguous between **miss**~1~, the relation
describing people who miss people/things in the emotional sense; **miss**~2~,
the relation describing people who fail to be on time for things; etc. Maybe
that's on the right track, but it misses (ha) the intuitive semantic connection
between all the **miss**'s.

Then again, maybe that's not the job of semantics. After all, there are
historical semantic connections between all sorts of words, but a semantic
theory certainly shouldn't describe all of them.

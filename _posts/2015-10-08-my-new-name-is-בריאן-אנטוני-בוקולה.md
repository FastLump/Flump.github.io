title: "My new name is בריאן אנתוני בוקולה"

I just opened an Israeli bank account, and my new name is: בריאן אנטוני בוקולה.
Woohoo! Here's what's going on:

- **בריאן (Brian)**: This would literally be pronounced \[ˈbrian\]
  (*BREE-ahn*), rather than the more normal \[ˈbraɪən\] (*BRY-uhn*), since י is
  pronounced \[i\] and א usually corresponds to \[a\]. But this transliteration
  appears to be quite standard. For example, the Hebrew Wikipedia pages of
  [Brian Eno][be], [Brian May][bm], and [Brian Wilson][bw] all have בריאן.
- **אנטוני (Anthony)**: This would literally be pronounced \[ˈantoˌni\]
  (*AHN-toh-nee*), rather than \[ˈænθəˌni\] (*AN-thuh-nee*), since ט is
  pronounced \[t\]. (Hebrew doesn't have the \[θ\] sound.) But again, this
  seems to be quite standard.[^t]
- **בוקולה (Buccola)**: This would literally be pronounced \[ˈbukoˌla\]
  (*BOO-koh-la*),[^uo] which is pretty much how it's pronounced in Italian,
  except without the geminated \[k\]. My family happens to pronounce it
  \[ˌbjuˈkolə\] (*byoo-KOH-luh*), but ever since I lived in Italy, I now go
  back and forth. \[ˈbukoˌla\] seems cross-linguistically easier for people to
  pronounce, since [bj] is quite an uncommon onset cluster.

[^t]: Actually, there are *two* Hebrew letters for the sound [t]: ט (*tet*) and
      ת (*tav*). And in fact, Google search for "Anthony in Hebrew" actually
      yields אנתוני, but so far no one has transcribed my middle name like
      that.

[^uo]: Or \[ˈbukula\], or \[ˈbokola\], or \[ˈbokula\], since ו (*vav*) can be
       either \[u\] or \[o\], depending on the word.

Funny story: The clerk at the bank actually transliterated my first name
slightly differently: as בריין instead of בריאן. That is, א (*aleph*) became י
(*yod*), giving rise to two י's (*yods*) in a row. (At the time, I didn't
notice... I was just signing papers left and right.) Now, י is normally
pronounce \[i\], so at first I thought that people reading בריין would say
\[ˈbriʔin\] (*BREE-een*), with a glottal stop, but Hebrew actually has a way to
indicate a glottal stop, e.g. א, so on second thought that seemed unlikely. In
the end, I hypothesized that two yods was the clerk's way of indicating a
non-Hebrew a diphthong, e.g. [aɪ], as in [ˈbraɪən]. This hypothesis was
confirmed when, later, a friend told me that בריין is exactly how he would
write [breɪn], i.e. transliterate the word *brain*.

So, no matter where I go, no matter what language or alphabet, my name ends up
being misspelled as *brain*. D'oh!

**Bonus:** A picture of the name plate on my and my colleague Andreas Haida's
new office. (Ignore the misplaced dot.) Notice that Andreas's last name, which
is pronounced \[ˈhaɪdə\], has a double yod, so here's another case where יי =
\[aɪ\]. Notice also that *Dr.* is ד״ר. The thing between ד (*dalet*) and ר
(*resh*) is not a double yod or anything. It's called [geryashim][ger]---or
*double geresh*---which is a special symbol that indicates an acronym and other
short forms.

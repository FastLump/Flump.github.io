In my free time, I'm reading the classic Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1981,
*Introduction to Montague Semantics*, and came across this wonderful quote on
the use of possible worlds in model-theoretic semantics, which I thought I'd
post, both for others to read and as a bookmark for myself to have on hand in
the future.

> [I]t would seem that the value of any model-theoretic analysis involving
> possible worlds will depend on (1) how successfully it can be carried out
> technically, and (2) whether it results in definitions of validity and
> entailment among sentences of the formal language that reasonably match our
> intuitions about entailment and validity among the corresponding English
> sentences (taking into account the syntactic limits of the formal language).
> Any reasonably simple model-theoretic analysis of a semantic problem of
> natural language that satisfies these two requirements merits our serious
> attention (at least until a better model-theoretic analysis of the same
> problem is available), even if the primitive entities required in the model
> theory appear somewhat mysterious at first. If such an analysis meeting these
> requirements but involving some mysterious entity such as possible worlds is
> presented, then it behooves us to try to elaborate on the analysis and to try
> to further elucidate the mysterious entity involved. We are *not* entitled to
> reject such an analysis out of hand because we dislike the entities involved.

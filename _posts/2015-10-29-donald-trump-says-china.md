Came across this video recently of Donald Trump saying "China" over and over
again.

It's pretty funny, of course. But politics aside, I thought it was interesting
that after watching it for several minutes (yeah, I watched the whole
thing...), I started to get the impression that he was actually speaking a
different language --- *China-ese*, if you will. I suppose that's because the
instances of him saying "China" all vary in pitch, intensity, duration, etc.,
so back-to-back-to-back they start to feel linguistically coherent. And then
the parts where he actually injects a bit of English kind of feel like
code-switching. Weird.

Of course, this exact phenomenon has been exploited at least once already, in
my favorite scene of one of my favorite movies, *Being John Malkovich*. Enjoy.

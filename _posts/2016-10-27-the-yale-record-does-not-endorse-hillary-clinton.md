This is just a bookmark to remind myself to use [this wonderful little article
by The Yale Record][yale-record] next time I teach pragmatics.

Here is the full text:

> In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic
> candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for
> president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a
> tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are "absolutely
> prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in,
> any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for
> elective public office."
>
> This year's presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no
> different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally
> unendorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code.
>
> In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton's exemplary leadership during
> her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to
> serving and improving this country---a commitment to which she has dedicated
> her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not
> encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern
> American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass
> ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8.
>
> The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein.

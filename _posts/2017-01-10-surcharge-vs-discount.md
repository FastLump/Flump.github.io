Semantics in the news (very broadly speaking): Not paying a surcharge vs.
getting a discount --- is there a difference? [In today's Supreme Court case,
freedom of speech meets your wallet][538]:

>"You can imagine that a rational person would look at a cash discount,
>understand that it's functionally the same as a credit card surcharge, and make
>his decision accordingly," said Todd Rogers, a professor of public policy at
>Harvard. "But the cool and important contribution that behavioral science can
>make here is to highlight how people behave in reality, which is not in this
>so-called rational way." The word "surcharge," he said, prompts consumers to
>think about the price differential in a way that "discount" does not --- which,
>in turn, has an effect on their willingness to use cash.

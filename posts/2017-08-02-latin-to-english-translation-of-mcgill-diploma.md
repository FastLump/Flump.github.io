We -- the Governors, the Chancellor, and the Associates of McGill University --
located in Montreal, Canada, send greetings to all those whom this document
reaches. We -- the Governors, the Principal and Vice-Chancellor, and the
Associates of the university -- attest that, since he has completed the
prescribed curriculum of study with diligence and has duly carried out all the
training charged to him, we have made Brian Anthony Buccola a Doctor of
Philosophy and have granted him all the honors, rights, and privileges
pertaining to that degree. To confirm this, we have taken care that this
document be signed with the seal of the university and that the names of those
in charge of academic affairs be signed below. Dated June 7, 2016.

Dean · Secretary-General · Honourable Chancellor · Principal and Vice-Chancellor

**NB:** I've translated the titles of the signatories by [looking their names
up](http://www.mcgill.ca/about/administration) and using their English titles.
That's why *RECTRIX* is translated as *Principal and Vice-Chancellor*, for
instance. As for *SOCII*, I'm not sure if this refers to a specific body, with
a specific title (e.g. the [senate](http://www.mcgill.ca/senate/)). Assuming it
doesn't (otherwise, I would've expected *SENATUS*, for example), the word can
be translated as *associates*, *members*, *fellows*, or similar.

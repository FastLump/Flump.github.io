**If less than five people did a certain thing, then is it not the case that
five or more people did that thing? It depends on the thing.**

That's what I would reply to the question posed in [this hilarious AskReddit
thread][rd]: "PhD's of Reddit: What is a dumbed down summary of your thesis?"

There are some real gems in there. Some of them actually managed to teach me
something:

> Making new magnets from old magnets because we're running out of magnets.  
> -- IAmAHiggsBoson

> People trying meditation for the first time get aroused.  
> -- PainMatrix

Others, less so:

> Sand washes away. Don't build important stuff on it.  
> -- zoidy-1

The funniest ones (to me) are the ones that subtly convey (by implicature or by
presupposition, it appears) that their dissertation was a disaster, pointless,
inconclusive, etc.

> You can make antimatter move in strange ways if you set your equipment up
> wrong.  
> -- DrTBag

> Does music express emotions or just elicit them? Read the next 200 pages to
> not find out.  
> -- welldogmycats

> People sometimes think about animals as if they're people. People like those
> animals a little more than regular animals. Except when they don't. I can't
> believe they gave me a PhD.  
> -- too_many_mangos

Be sure to also check out [lol my thesis][lol] for more hilarity.

**Bonus summary: If less than five people did a certain thing, then is it
possible that no one did that thing? It still depends on the thing.**

I'm currently reading [Benjamin Franklin's autobiography][src],
and as a former student of Latin, Greek, and (afterwards) Romance languages,
I was struck by the following passage.

> I had begun in 1733 to study languages;
> I soon made myself so much a master of the French
> as to be able to read the books with ease.
> I then undertook the Italian.
> An acquaintance, who was also learning it,
> us'd often to tempt me to play chess with him.
> Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare for study,
> I at length refus'd to play any more,
> unless on this condition,
> that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task,
> either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart,
> or in translations, etc.,
> which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon honour,
> before our next meeting.
> As we play'd pretty equally,
> we thus beat one another into that language.
> I afterwards with a little painstaking,
> acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their books also.
> 
> I have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a Latin school,
> and that when very young,
> after which I neglected that language entirely.
> But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish,
> I was surpris'd to find,
> on looking over a Latin Testament,
> that I understood so much more of that language than I had imagined,
> which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it,
> and I met with more success,
> as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.
> 
> From these circumstances,
> I have thought that there is some inconsistency
> in our common mode of teaching languages.
> We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin,
> and, having acquir'd that,
> it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it;
> and yet we do not begin with the Greek,
> in order more easily to acquire the Latin.
> It is true that,
> if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps,
> you will more easily gain them in descending;
> but certainly, if you begin with the lowest
> you will with more ease ascend to the top;
> and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth,
> whether, since many of those who begin with the Latin
> quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency,
> and what they have learnt becomes almost useless,
> so that their time has been lost,
> it would not have been better to have begun with the French,
> proceeding to the Italian, etc.;
> for, tho', after spending the same time,
> they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the Latin,
> they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two,
> that, being in modern use,
> might be serviceable to them in common life.

The idea to use the outcomes of chess games
as a way to learn languages is pretty cool (and amusing), of course,
but I was particularly struck by Franklin's progressiveness
regarding the classical languages.
I can't imagine that many people at that time shared that view.

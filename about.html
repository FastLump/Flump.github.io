<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am a PhD student in theoretical linguistics at <a target="_blank"
    title="McGill University" href="http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/">McGill
    University</a>. My research interests primarily include formal semantics,
pragmatics, phonology, and mathematical and computational linguistics. I also
enjoy logic, linux, and beer.</p>

<p>This is my personal blog, where I write about any random thing that comes to
mind. You can find my official academic website <a target="_blank"

<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am a linguist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the <a target="_blank" title="LLCC" href="https://scholars.huji.ac.il/llcc/home">Language, Logic, and Cognition Center</a> of the <a target="_blank" title="HUJI" href="http://new.huji.ac.il/">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>. I did my PhD at <a target="_blank" title="McGill University" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. My research interests primarily include formal semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and mathematical and computational linguistics. I also enjoy logic, linux, and beer.</p>

<p>This is my personal blog, where I write about any random thing that comes to mind. You can find my official academic website <a target="_blank" href="http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~brian.buccola/">here</a>.</p>

I am a linguist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Language,
Logic, and Cognition Center][llcc] of the [Hebrew University of
Jerusalem][huji]. Before that, I did my PhD at [McGill University][mcgill]. And
before that, I studied math and classics (Latin and Ancient Greek) at [Loyola
University Chicago][luc].

Most of my research revolves around the interpretation of quantificational
expressions, especially so-called modified numerals, like *fewer than five*,
*at least three*, *up to ten*, and *between four and six*. I am also interested
in the formal properties of formal grammars and have worked in particular on
the differences in generative capacity between Optimality Theory and ordered
rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. You can read
about some of that stuff [here](/blog/).

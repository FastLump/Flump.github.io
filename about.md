I am a linguist working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Laboratoire de
Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique][lscp], a [CNRS][cnrs] lab, at the
[École Normale Supérieure][ens] in Paris. Before that, I was a postdoctoral
fellow at the [Language, Logic, and Cognition Center][llcc] of the [Hebrew
University of Jerusalem][huji]. Before that, I did my PhD at [McGill
University][mcgill] in Montreal. And before that, I studied math and classics
(Latin and Ancient Greek) at [Loyola University Chicago][luc]. I am originally
from New Orleans, Louisiana.

Most of my research revolves around the interpretation of quantificational
expressions, especially numerals, like *three* and *seven*, and so-called
modified numerals, like *fewer than five*, *at least three*, *up to ten*, and
*between four and six*. I am also interested in the formal properties of formal
grammars and have worked in particular on the differences in generative
capacity between Optimality Theory and ordered rewrite rules.

Apart from linguistics, I enjoy tinkering with Linux, learning about functional
programming (like Haskell), and (when I have time) brewing beer. You can read
about some of that stuff [here](/blog/).
